* noa₂co₂

There is no machine-readable data file available that gives daily atmospheric CO₂ readings.  Until the monitoring agencies and researchers make one, this fills in.

It scrapes the manually-entered data out of [[http://www.esrl.noaa.gov/gmd/ccgg/trends/monthly.html][Recent Daily Average Mauna Loa CO₂]] that is maintained by the [[http://www.esrl.noaa.gov/][Earth System Research Laboratory]] (part of the US government's National Oceanic & Atmospheric Administration).  That data is added to a CSV file.

* How to use it

This requires [[https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/][Ruby]] and the [[http://bundler.io/][Bundler]] gem.

To install:

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
git clone git@github.com:wdenton/noa2co2.git
cd noa2co2/
bundle install
#+END_SRC

To use:

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
./noa₂co₂.rb
